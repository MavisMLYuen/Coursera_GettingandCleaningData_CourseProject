Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the course project. To learn more about the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, please check out it's website on the UCI website. The following description of the data set was downloaded from the Data Set's website:

The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset were randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

File Descriptions

TidyData.txt - the tidy data set that was created for this task at Step 5. The text file is tab-delimited, and was produced from the UCI HAR Dataset data and the run_analysis.R script.
run_analysis.R - the R script that collected the UCI data and turned it into TidyData.txt using the 5 steps for the analyses.
CodeBook.md - provides the information on the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean the data.
